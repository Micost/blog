# üê≠ Data structures

{% hint style="info" %}
Data structures are abstract concepts that are created by human to store and organize data.
{% endhint %}

**Index**

* Native Data Structures
* Abstract Data Types
* Linear Data Structures



**Native Data Structures**

But there are some **native data structures** are built into a programming language.

* Arrays
* Strings
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Sets

**Abstract Data Types**

**ADTs**(Abstract Data Types) are the most common abstract **data types** in computer science:

* Stack
* Queue
* Linked list
* Tree
* Hash Table
* Set
* Map
* Graph
* Heap
* Priority queue

**What difference between Native data structures and ADT?**

Native data structures are built into a programming language commonly. ADTs are a way of defining the properties of a data structure. **A native data structure is an implementation of an ADT.** It is a concrete data structure that stores data in a specific way and supports a specific set of operations.

In general, native data structures are implemented using ADTs. ADTs provide a way to abstract away the details of the implementation. This makes it easier to use the data structure, and it also makes it easier to change the implementation in the future.

**Linear Data Structures**

It refers to a data structure where <mark style="color:blue;">data elements are arranged in</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**a linear**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">or</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**sequential order.**</mark> In other words, the data elements are stored one after another in memory, and there is a specific order in which they can be accessed.

The **linear** here means that the elements are arranged in a line or a sequence. This is in contrast to non-linear data structures, such as **trees** and **graphs**, where elements can be connected in any number of ways, and there is no inherent ordering of the elements.

Common examples of linear data structures:

* Array
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Tables
* Heaps
* Deques

We should choose the right data structure for a given task or help optimize the performance of code.
