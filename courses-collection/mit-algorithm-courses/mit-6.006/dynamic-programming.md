# Dynamic Programming

{% hint style="info" %}
Dynamic programming is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and storing the solutions to these subproblems for later use.
{% endhint %}

The key idea behind dynamic programming is to avoid solving the same subproblems multiple times by storing their solutions in a table or array. This allows us to reuse these solutions later when solving larger subproblems or the original problem.

Here, we use a loop tp compute the solutions to larger subproblems using the solutions to smaller subproblems.
