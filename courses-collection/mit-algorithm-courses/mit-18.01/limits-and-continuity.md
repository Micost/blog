**Definition of a limit**

```
// The limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L
lim   f(x) = L
x→a
```

If, for every positive number ε, there exists a positive number δ such that for all x satisfying 0 < |x - a| < δ, we have |f(x) - L| < ε.

The symbol ε (epsilon) represents the "error tolerance" we're willing to accept, and the symbol δ (delta) represents the "distance" from a that we need to be to ensure that the error is within our tolerance level.

**Evaluating limits using algebraic techniques and graphs**

* Direct substitution
* Factorization
* Rationalization
* L'Hopital's rule
* Graphical analysis

**The squeeze theorem**

It also known as the sandwich theorem or the prinching theorem. It is for evaluating limits.

Statement

Suppose that f(x), g(x), and h(x) are functions defined on some interval containing a point a (except possibly at a) and that for all x in that interval,

$$
g(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ h(x)
$$

If lim g(x) = L = lim h(x), then lim f(x) also exists and is equal to L.

**Limits at infinity**

Limits at infinity are a type of limit that describes the behavior of a function as the input variable x gets very large or very small.
