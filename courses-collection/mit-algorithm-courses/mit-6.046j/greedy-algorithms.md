# Greedy algorithms

{% hint style="info" %}
A greedy algorithm is a simple heuristic approach that seels to fins the optimal solution to a problem by making locally optimal choices at each step. In other words, <mark style="color:red;">it makes the best possible decision at each step wihtou considering the overall problem, hoping that whis will lead to the best possible solution overall.</mark>
{% endhint %}

The <mark style="color:red;">key feature</mark> of a greedy algorithm is that it <mark style="color:red;">makes a choice that seems best at the moment,</mark> without worrying about future consequences or whether that choice will lead to an optimal solution. This can often be a useful approach, as it is generally fast ans easy to implement, but it can also be risky, as it may not always produce the best possible solution.
