# Dynamic programming

{% hint style="info" %}
This technique involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems and then solving each sub-problem only once and sorting the solution for the future us. <mark style="color:red;">This can be more efficient than solving the sub-problems repeatedly.</mark>

The knapsack problem is <mark style="color:red;">a classic optimization problem</mark> in computer science and mathematics. The problem can be stated as follows: given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, <mark style="color:red;">determine the number of each item to include in a collection</mark> so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is maximized.
