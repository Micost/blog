# ðŸ“Š Graph Theory

* A graph consists of a set of vertices (also called <mark style="color:red;">nodes</mark>) and a set of edges (also called <mark style="color:red;">links</mark>) that connect pairs of vertices.
* Graphs can be directed (where edges have a direction) or undirected (where edges do not have a direction).
* Graphs can be used to model many real-world systems, including <mark style="color:red;">social networks</mark>, transportation networks, and <mark style="color:red;">computer networks</mark>.
* Graph theory has many important concepts and applications, including <mark style="color:red;">shortest paths</mark>, <mark style="color:red;">maximum flow</mark>, <mark style="color:red;">minimum spanning trees</mark>, and graph coloring.
* Graph algorithms are widely used in computer science, including in <mark style="color:red;">optimization problems</mark>, <mark style="color:red;">data structures</mark>, and artificial intelligence.
