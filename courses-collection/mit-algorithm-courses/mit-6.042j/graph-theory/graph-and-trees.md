# ðŸŒ´ Graph and Trees

**Definitions and Basic Properties**

* A graph is a collection of vertices (also called nodes) and edges (also called links) that connect pairs of vertices.
* Graphs can be directed (where edges have a direction) or undirected (where edges do not have a direction).
* The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges incident to it.
* A tree is a connected, acyclic graph.
* Trees have many useful properties, such as the fact that any two vertices in a tree are connected by a unique path.
* Binary trees are trees where each node has at most two children.
* Trees can be used to model hierarchical relationships, such as family trees or organizational charts.
* Spanning trees are trees that include all the vertices of a graph.
