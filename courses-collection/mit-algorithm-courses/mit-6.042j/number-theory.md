**The Division Algorithm**

{% hint style="info" %}
The Division Algorithm is a fundamental concept in number theory that describes how to divide two integers and find their <mark style="color:red;">quotient</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">remainder</mark>.
{% endhint %}

Given two integers a and b, with b not equal to 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r, where 0 <= r < |b|.

* The integer q is called the quotient and r is called the remainder.
