# ðŸ¦™ Large Language Model

### Concepts

LLM is a type of artificial intelligence(AI) algorithm that use deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. LLMs are trained with immense amounts of data and use self-supervised learning to predict the next token in a sentence, given the surrounding context. Once an LLM has been trained, it can be fine-tuned for a wide range of NLP tasks, including generating and classifying text, answering questions.

### Stop Words

Stop words are a set of commonly used words in any language that are used to eliminate unimportant words, allowing applications to focus on the important words instead. <mark style="color:purple;">**In natural language(NLP)**</mark> and text mining applications, <mark style="color:red;">**stop words**</mark> are used to <mark style="color:red;">**eliminate words**</mark> that <mark style="color:red;">**are so widely used that they carry very little useful information**</mark>.&#x20;

## LLMs

### LLaMA

In March 2023, a large language model (LLM) called `LLaMA` was leaked online. `LLaMA` was developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) and is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

### Chinchilla

Megatron-Turing NLG is an open-source large language model developed by Google AI. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code.

### Jurassic-1 Jumbo

Jurassic-1 Jumbo is an open-source large language model developed by Google AI. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code.

## Libraries

[**ChatLlama**](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebuly/tree/main/optimization/chatllama)

It is a library that allows you to efficiently leverage LLMs fine-tuning capabilities using your own data and the least amount of computing possible.

[**Langchain**](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not.
