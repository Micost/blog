# üçâ The GNU Hurd

The GNU Hurd is a free and open-source <mark style="color:red;">microkernel-based operating system</mark> that is part of the GNU project. It was started in the early 1990s as a <mark style="color:red;">replacement for the Unix kernel</mark>, which the goal of providing <mark style="color:red;">a more flexible</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">extensible system</mark> than the <mark style="color:red;">traditional monolithic kernel</mark> approach.

The Hurd is unique in that <mark style="color:red;">it consists of a set of servers</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">running on top of</mark> the microkernel, each providing different system services such as file systems, network protocols, and device drivers. These servers <mark style="color:red;">communicate</mark> <mark style="color:red;">with</mark> each other <mark style="color:red;">through a message-passing mechanism</mark>, which allows for <mark style="color:red;">more efficient</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">reliable communication</mark> than traditional inter-process communication methods.

Despite its potential advantages, the Hurd has not yet achieved widespread adoption or use. It has been <mark style="color:red;">under development for many years</mark> and is <mark style="color:red;">still considered to be in a pre-production state</mark>. Some of the challenges that have contributed to its slow development include a lack of developer resources, <mark style="color:red;">limited hardware support</mark>, and difficulty of porting existing Unix applications to <mark style="color:yellow;">Hurd's unique architecture</mark>.

However, the Hurd remains an important project in the <mark style="color:green;">free and open-source software community</mark>, and its developers continue to work towards improving its functionality and stability.

I am a maintainer for the Hurd project. Let's break down the steps of how to contribute to this project.

**Resources for connection with the GNU Hurd project**

* IRC
* The Hurd mailing lists
* The Hurd wiki
* Bug reporting

But these tools are a little bit hard to use for me.
