# Tutorial for starting

**Overview**

Also, the Hurd wiki probably can tell us everything, but it would be better if I can show some tutorials for beginners. More choices are good than only one.

**Topics**

1. Introduction
2. Setting up the development environment
3. Understanding the Hurd architecture
4. Creating a simple Hurd application
5. Contributing to the Hurd project
6. Conclusion

**Introduction**

The GNU Hurd project is free and open-source, but it is quite different from the open-source projects we have now. Here is a philosophy from the GNU Hurd Wiki.
