# ðŸš€ About

Iâ€™m Bowen Li and my code name is **Aisuko**. It looks great.

Iâ€™d like to do something really interesting, like explore the GNU Hurd project. The project same age as me, itâ€™s really cool.

And Iâ€™d like to explore the structure of the whole world. So Iâ€™m not interested in the server, but the infrastructures need to update here.

Iâ€™d like to research more about the [microkernel](https://dev.to/aisuko/the-concepts-of-microkernel-3i08) because the HA or distribution servers work on a monolithic kernel and are not stable(Itâ€™s a joke). And their lots of things that need to learn and research.

And lots of basic automatic tools there must have I guess.

Iâ€™m a Sky photographer on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/people/aisukoli/) and all the photos are free to download.
